## Current Blockers

### Technical Issues

- Hard-coded Chinese strings instead of resources
- No database migration strategy

### Missing Core Features
- Lunar calendar support not implemented
- Repeat events (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly) missing
- Reminders and notifications system absent
- Data backup/restore functionality not built
- Password protection feature missing

## Next Steps

2. Implement event editing functionality
3. Add event deletion with confirmation
4. Fix widget lifecycle management

### High Priority Features
1. Implement reminder/notification system

2. Date calculator tool
3. Milestone tracking
4. Password protection

## Development Environment

- **IDE**: Android Studio
- **Build System**: Gradle with Kotlin DSL
- **Min SDK**: 24 (Android 7.0)
- **Target SDK**: 36 (Android 15)
- **Kotlin JVM Target**: 11

## Testing Status

⚠️ **No tests implemented** - Only example test files exist
- Need unit tests for ViewModels
- Need instrumented tests for Room DAOs
- Need UI tests for critical user flows

## Notes

The project aims to be a 1:1 clone of the popular Chinese Days Matter (倒数日) app. Current implementation has the visual styling mostly complete but lacks many core features. The architecture is solid with MVVM and Repository pattern providing good separation of concerns.
