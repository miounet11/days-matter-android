# Project Brief

## Executive Summary

**BigTime** is an open-source Android application that recreates the functionality and design of the popular Days Matter (ÂÄíÊï∞Êó•) app. It helps users track important dates by showing countdown timers for future events and day counters for past events, presented in a visually distinctive card-based interface.

## Project Purpose

### What It Does
- Tracks important dates and events in users' lives
- Calculates and displays days until future events (countdown)
- Calculates and displays days since past events (count-up)
- Organizes events by categories for easy management
- Provides at-a-glance information through widgets and notifications

### Why It Exists
- Provide a free, open-source alternative to Days Matter
- Offer privacy-focused date tracking without ads or data collection
- Create a customizable platform for personal date management
- Support both English and Chinese-speaking users (planned)

## Key Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Feature Parity**: Achieve core functionality matching Days Matter app
2. **User Experience**: Maintain intuitive, visually appealing interface
3. **Performance**: Ensure smooth, responsive app performance
4. **Reliability**: Provide stable, crash-free experience

### Secondary Goals
1. **Localization**: Support multiple languages and calendar systems
2. **Extensibility**: Build modular architecture for future features
3. **Community**: Foster open-source contribution and feedback
4. **Privacy**: Maintain user data privacy and security

## Success Criteria
